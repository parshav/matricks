# Matricks

A tiny, fun side project for mathematics.

### Modules

Currently there are two modules within the matricks project, namely `matricks`
and `sets`.

`matricks` currently is empty.

#### sets

Contains some functions related to sets, more specifically discrete maths.
Inspiration comes from a Graph Theory book by Agnarsson and Greenlaw.

### Purpose

Learning various math topics via code is driving this.
